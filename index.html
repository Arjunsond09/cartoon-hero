		<h2>About Monica</h2>
		 <p style="font-size: 30px">Monica Geller is a fictional character from the hit TV show <!-- link to future friends website --> <a href="https://friends.fandom.com/wiki/Friends" >F.R.I.E.N.D.S</a>. Played by Courteney Cox, Monica was known as the Mother of the group; and her Greenwich Village apartment was one of the group's main gathering places throughout the series.

	       Monica was born in 1969. Monica is Ross' younger sister, and the daughter of Jack and Judy Geller. Monica, like the rest of her family, is Jewish. She had a slightly difficult childhood from Ross. She had, and still has, a difficult relationship with her parents, especially with her mother, who unconsciously favors Ross over her on various occasions and usually cares about him more than Monica.  

	       After college, Monica moved into her Grandmothers' old apartment with her friend Phoebe Buffay, accross the hall from Chandler Bing, her brother's old roomate, whom she had seen before on thanksgiving. 

	       While she is kind, caring and friendly, Monica is perhaps most notorious for her obsessive cleanliness, classifying places by cleanliness, where 'Monica-clean' is even cleaner than 'Health-Department-clean'. She is also known to talk abnormally loudly and for her bossiness and unnatural organizational skills. Phoebe and Rachel also call her high-maintenance. Aside from being a neat-freak, Monica can also be bossy and somewhat competitive, hating to lose in competitions. Although less so than Chandler, Ross, Rachel or even Phoebe, Monica also possesses a snide and sarcastic wit that is more subtle than her friends'.</p>
